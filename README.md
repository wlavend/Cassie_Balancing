This code is used to balance the Cassie biped robot on one leg in MuJoCo. The model used can be found [here](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie/blob/main/agility_cassie/README.md): 

You can download prebuilt binaries for MuJoCo from the GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco/releases/), or if you are working with Python, you can install the native bindings from PyPI via pip install mujoco. For alternative installation instructions, see [here](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco#installation).

I have modified the XML file to include the perfect positioning of the robot on one-leg (and one more keyframe wherein a ~1.5cm height transition works).
